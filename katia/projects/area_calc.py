# baby's first python code
# input takes in data and print sends out data
# For example, print("Today is Sunday") prints out today is sunday in the terminal

# name = input("Tell me your name:")
# age = input('...and your age:')
# print(name, 'you are' + age )

# Calculate the area of a circle
# pi r**2

radius = input('Enter the radius of your circle(m): ')
area = 3.142 * int(radius) **2 #int turns a str into a num
print('The area of your circle is:', area)
